## Welcome Contributor! :heart: 

This is the contributor page for the MagicMirror Module project `MMM-Assistant`.

We are dearly excited to see that you are interested in contributing to this module.
This is your guide for doing so. The following text is meant as a guide line, but in 
reality you can skip all the text below! In either case it was just stolen from the
Atom project [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Is there anything I want to say? 

Perhaps a very few things:

* Please use a `4-space` tabulator stop and do not use `TAB` characters for code formatting.  
  (I actually love TABs, but most people don't know how to use different spacings.)
* Do not remove my code comments, unless they are wrong. I love keeping sensible comments!
* Do not use that *effin' Java commenting system with bunch of `/** usless blah */`.
* Keep the MAX code line lengths between 80-120 characters. 
* Use `function() {` rather than `function (){`.
* Avoid using a separate line for the **starting** curly bracket, `{`, unless its in a JSON or object.  
* Use UTF-8 file encoding where possible.

I think that's about it, for now.

Thanks again for wanting to contribute!

:heart:

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that Atom crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in `Console.app` under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [CPU profile capture](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance) with your report.
* **If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it**, that normally means that you have a syntax error in one of your themes or in your `styles.less`. Try running in [Safe Mode](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode) and using a different theme or comment out the contents of your `styles.less` to see if that fixes the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance-problems-with-the-dev-tools-cpu-profiler)?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from [the releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Atom are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `atom -v` in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette).
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running Atom in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Which [packages](#atom-and-packages) do you have installed?** You can get that list by running `apm list --installed`.
* **Are you using [local configuration files](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/)** `config.cson`, `keymap.cson`, `snippets.cson`, `styles.less` and `init.coffee` to customize Atom? If so, provide the contents of those files, preferably in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) or with a link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).
* **Are you using Atom with multiple monitors?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
* **Which keyboard layout are you using?** Are you using a US layout or some other layout?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [debugging guide](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)** for tips â€” you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using [the latest version of Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version) and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [Atom's or packages' config settings](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-atom-and-package-settings).
* **Check if there's already [a package](https://atom.io/packages) which provides that enhancement.**
* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#atom-and-packages).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Atom users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community package](#atom-and-packages).
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of Atom you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `atom -v` in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette).
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).

#### Local development

Atom Core and all packages can be developed locally. For instructions on how to do this, see the following sections in the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io):

* [Hacking on Atom Core][hacking-on-atom-core]
* [Contributing to Official Atom Packages][contributing-to-official-atom-packages]

### Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the [JavaScript](#javascript-styleguide) and [CoffeeScript](#coffeescript-styleguide) styleguides.
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) specs in the `./spec` folder. Run them using `atom --test spec`. See the [Specs Styleguide](#specs-styleguide) below.
* Document new code based on the [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
* End all files with a newline
* [Avoid platform-dependent code](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/cross-platform-compatibility/)

    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@` in CoffeeScript or `static` in JavaScript)
    * Instance methods and properties

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug

    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```

### CoffeeScript Styleguide

* Set parameter defaults without spaces around the equal sign
    * `clear = (count=1) ->` instead of `clear = (count = 1) ->`
* Use spaces around operators
    * `count + 1` instead of `count+1`
* Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)
* Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
* Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
    * `a is b` instead of `a == b`
* Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:
    * `{a: 1, b: 2}` instead of `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`
* Include a single line of whitespace between methods.
* Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which
  should be lower-case:
  * `getURI` instead of `getUri`
  * `uriToOpen` instead of `URIToOpen`
* Use `slice()` to copy an array
* Add an explicit `return` when your function ends with a `for`/`while` loop and
  you don't want it to return a collected array.
* Use `this` instead of a standalone `@`
  * `return this` instead of `return @`

### Specs Styleguide

- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) specs in the `./spec` folder.
- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation.
- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.

#### Example

```coffee
describe 'a dog', ->
 it 'barks', ->
 # spec here
 describe 'when the dog is happy', ->
  it 'wags its tail', ->
  # spec here
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [AtomDoc](https://github.com/atom/atomdoc).
* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`

#### Example

```coffee
# Public: Disable the package with the given name.
#
# * `name`    The {String} name of the package to disable.
# * `options` (optional) The {Object} with disable options (default: {}):
#   * `trackTime`     A {Boolean}, `true` to track the amount of time taken.
#   * `ignoreErrors`  A {Boolean}, `true` to catch and ignore errors thrown.
# * `callback` The {Function} to call after the package has been disabled.
#
# Returns `undefined`.
disablePackage: (name, options, callback) ->
```

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Atom repositories, but some are specific to `atom/atom`.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues across `atom/atom` and all Atom-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+label%3Abug+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) or perhaps [open pull requests in `atom/atom` which haven't been reviewed yet](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+repo%3Aatom%2Fatom+comments%3A0). To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in `atom/atom` only and also across all Atom repositories. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `atom/atom` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
